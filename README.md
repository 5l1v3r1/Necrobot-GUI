# Necrobot-GUI
Grafic User Interface to Necrobot
This was my beta for a GUI on necrobot (bot for pokemon go) now, niantic forced the developers to stop the proyect. It was tested with the 0.8.5 version of necrobot.

I want to take advantage to say fuck niantic, they finished the work of the comunity to start selling their own bot, ripping the code of the users.
